# 👩‍💻 Gabi Hgall — Portfolio Website

As part of my final personal project for the **Femcoders Bootcamp**, I built a website to showcase my work to potential clients and employers.  
This portfolio brings together projects from **UX design, interior design, brand design, events & workshops**, and even **psychology papers** — a full snapshot of my professional journey.

The website includes:
- A **contact form** for easy communication  
- An **admin view** protected by a password  
- A **CRUD panel** where I can create, edit, and delete projects  
- Integration with **MockAPI**, where all project data is stored  

One of the core parts of the project was developing the **brand identity (GabiHgall)** and implementing the full front-end of the website.
